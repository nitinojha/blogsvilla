Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley served as joint global coordinator, with Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, and Wing Lung Bank.\r\nThe company previously raised a loan in 2014, months before it raised a $1 billion venture capital round at a valuation of $45 billion. There’s no suggestion that it is about to raise money from investors now, however.\r\nThe loan is aimed at further Xiaomi’s key focuses as put forward by CEO Lei Jun this year, they including growing its international footprint — Xiaomi now sells, or has sales partners, in over 20 countries — and building out an offline presence.\r\nThe company has opened 149 Mi Home stores in China, while it has opened its first in India, where it hopes to reach 100 stores over the next two years.

This year, it declined to give full numbers for 2016, marking its first non-reveal in its history, following an apparently disappointing year as competitors like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo released competitive devices and developed wide offline sales networks. Issues began appearing when Xiaomi missed its sales target for 2015, selling “over 70 million” devices but not the 80 million that Lei had previously forecast.\r\nThe past quarter, however, Xiaomi shipped an impressive 23.16 million smartphones, up 70 percent on the previous quarter.

Investors haven’t always agreed with the decisions made under his leadership, but his unbridled enthusiasm has never been in question — and the new app is no exception.\r\nUnfortunately, however, it’s not that great. On the face of it, QuikStories is Instagram Stories or Apple Clips for the action camera. It’s the shortest path from a GoPro camera to social media. The app automatically edits clips and photos into a short video, complete with music and transitions. It is, Woodman believes, the missing link standing between the company’s cameras and meaningful mainstream adoption.\r\n“Our customers [had] a bottleneck to actually transforming clips into an exciting video that they could enjoy themselves and share with others,” Woodman tells TechCrunch. “QuikStories is the uncorking of that bottleneck and the opening of the floodgates and making it easier for customers to easily take advantage of the GoPro in the form of a story that’s easily generated on their phone.”', '2017-08-11 08:48:51', 'author', 'admin/imageupload/go pro.jpg', ''),

Three years after discontinuing the iPod classic, Apple is finally doing the same to its lower-end brethren, the shuffle and nano. The company pulled both iconic MP3 players from its site earlier today and has since confirmed with TechCrunch that this is, indeed, the end.\r\nThat makes the iPod touch the last device standing with the once ubiquitous iPod name. And there’s actually some happier news on that front — the company is increasing the capacities of the touch to 64GB at $199 and 128GB at $299 today. It previously sold 16GB and 64GB models at the same prices.\r\n“Today, we are simplifying our iPod lineup with two models of iPod touch now with double the capacity starting at just $199 and we are discontinuing the iPod shuffle and iPod nano,” said an Apple spokesperson in  a statement.\r\nFor the past several years, Apple has been fairly clear that the iPhone would eat up the traditional non-network iPods — and that it was comfortable with that happening. The rise of the iPhone and the company’s push into streaming with Apple Music have helped make music ownership a thing of the past. \r\nThe fact that there has been no nano updated in five years should have been a solid indicator (if you needed one) that Apple was focused on devices that can run apps. The most important of those apps for an iPod, of course, is Apple Music. It makes very little sense in Apple’s current universe for it to support devices that can’t.\r\nThe iPod touch getting twice the storage at the same price is a nice send off for the no-radio iPods.

Help, it turns out, is just a click, a tap, or a phone call away. Check out what these companies, ranked from 1 to 50, have to offer and tell us which ones are your personal favorites.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of awesome health and wellness startups out there, and we had a hard time choosing just 50 to feature.
